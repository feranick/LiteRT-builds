# LiteRT-builds
LiteRT cross-platform builds

## Why this repo?

The information provided in the [official tensorflow lite page for building `whl` packages ](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/build/cmake_pip) to cross-compile TFlite for different architectures is a good start. However there seem to be several issues. This repo aims at providing more info towards successful compilation. And some binaries as well.
